This patch removes some bogus stuff from the pgtcl configure script;
in particular it gets rid of rpath specifications that we don't want
or need on an RPM platform, as well as long-obsolete optimization
bypasses.

We also remove some direct hacks on LIBOBJS because modern Autoconf
doesn't like them; not worth fixing properly since they won't be
invoked on our systems anyway.

Finally, tweak Makefile.in to ensure that the -L switch for libpq appears
before any -L for the Tcl libraries during the link.  This prevents the
generated library from being bound to the wrong version of libpq when
building on a machine that has an older version of libpq already installed
(bug #166665).
