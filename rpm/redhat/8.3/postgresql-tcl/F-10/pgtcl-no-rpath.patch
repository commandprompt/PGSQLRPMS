This patch prevents use of rpath, which isn't wanted on Fedora.

Also, tweak Makefile.in to ensure that the -L switch for libpq appears
before any -L for the Tcl libraries during the link.  This prevents the
generated library from being bound to the wrong version of libpq when
building on a machine that has an older version of libpq already installed
(bug #166665).
